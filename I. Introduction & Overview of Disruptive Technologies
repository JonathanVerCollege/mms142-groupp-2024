Disruptive technologies are innovations that create big changes in how we do things, often making things easier or more accessible. Unlike in other cases where technologies simply replace firms or products in the market, these technologies expand the market with something more. They frequently provide new possibilities and access to a product or service. They revolve around growth and change —not competition— and may even lead to the transformation of industries by offering a new way of doing things and creating a larger pie that everyone can share.

One of these technologies is 3D printing that has changed the manufacturing industry by enabling organizations to produce objects from digital models, bypassing several phases of production. Just like Netflix revolutionized the entertainment industry; offering streaming services and Uber revolutionized the transportation industry; by offering an on-demand service, 3D printing is revolutionizing the industry of designing and manufacturing products. This technology is also opening up new markets because it allows those small companies and individuals to produce differentiated products at lower costs and in a shorter time span.

3D printing also brings new opportunities into industries by changing the perspectives at flexibility and design. Its use makes it possible to come up with complex designs which would not be possible with traditional methods. With this, industries can bring faster changes in their sectors. In addition, it has been established that 3D printing has the potential to greatly minimize the huge supply chain due to local production thus reducing the reliance on overseas suppliers and transport. Hence, the decentralization provides businesses with flexibility, where they can adapt better to market requirements and lower their expenses.

When disruptive technology enters the mainstream, it changes consumer behavior and streamlines business opportunities. This includes an innovative and competitive business environment, the development of new business models, and a greater ability to access new markets. Innovating disruptively is a necessity in the business world, forcing the market to aim to optimize products and services and companies to develop innovative strategies. Companies that adapt smoothly and embrace disruptive technology enter a fresh, cutting-edge process for positive consumer impact.

Although not every innovation proves successful and forces some companies to change based on technology, disruptive innovation remains necessary by generating new markets and setting a standard in established competition to increase customer value. Consumers and companies alike benefit from disruptive technologies in many ways, including:
- Business Growth and Dynamic Progress. The produced disruptive technology promotes growth in current or new industries and generates positive changes. Companies adapt based on the disruptive process caused by the technology as they are met with prime business opportunities. 
- Fulfill Demands. No company meets all consumer needs. Disruptive technology facilitates the search for niches in the market, resulting in revolutionary research to identify areas with improvement needs, and offers consumers and societal innovative benefits, such as faster production, gaining an advantage over other businesses.
- Improve Company Financial Efficiency. Disruption provides a high quality of life with better and cheaper alternatives. This produces cheap and new products and services from companies and their disruptive transformation processes that increase productivity from inflexible strategies and structures to fulfill the constantly changing consumer's evolution and improvement and the global marketplace needs.

The initial and potential applications for innovation are often experimental or unproven. Consumers can dismiss new technologies as unnecessary or a waste of money upon release, considering the purpose and value of their predecessors if in need of replacement. This causes disruptive technology to demand time to stabilize in the marketplace. Innovation and disruption are radical changes that are challenging for many businesses, but once achieved, they produce remarkable results.
